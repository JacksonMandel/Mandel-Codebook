# Overview
  This dataset combines several key indicators around democracy, political openness, informal employment, and corruption.  The objective is to facilitate the study of interactions between corruption and political economy on a cross-country comparative basis.
  
---
     
# Sources and Methodology
  The data in this dataset is derived from three key sources: the V-Dem dataset, Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, and the International Labor Organization's ILOSTAT data on informal unemployment.
  
## V-Dem Data
  6 indicators (Polyarchy, LibDem, ParticipDem, EgalDem, FreeFairElect, EqualAccess) are derived from the V-Dem dataset.  The V-Dem data is in the form of ratings on a scale from 0 to 1, assessed by country experts.  In all of the variables used in this dataset, higher scores represent greater presence of a particular feature (free and fair elections, egalitarian democracy, etc.)
  V-Dem typically uses five experts per country-year observation, out of a pool of around 4,000 total experts. They use a model to algorithmically estimate the reliability of each expert relative to other experts, as well as the extent to which their assessment differs from those of other experts.  These are then used to weight each expert's assessment relative to others in calculating final scores.
  
## Corruption Perceptions Index Data
  6 indicators (CPIScore, CPIScoreRank, CPIScoreStdErr, EconIntelRating, SnPGloInsightsRating, WEFRating) are derived from the Corruption Perceptions Index.  This index is maintained by Transparency International, and includes the overall CPI score - which is an average of corruption scores assigned by a group of major international organizations - as well as the original scores used to calculate that number.  Our dataset includes the CPI score, as well a selection of the original scores used to calculate it.
  These variables are on a 0 to 100 scale, with 0 being least corrupt and 100 being more corrupt.  For our dataset, we have recalculated the scores to be on a 0 to 1 scale.
  
## ILOSTAT Data
  3 indicators (TotInfLab, MaleInfLab, FemaleInfLab) are derived from ILOSTAT's data on informal employment.  These variables are on a 0 to 1 scale, with 0 representing 0% of a given population employed in the informal economy, and 1 representing 100% of a given population employed in the informal economy. Employment in the informal economy constitutes employment in "Informal productive activities," which are defined as "all productive activities carried out by persons or economic units that are - in law or in practice - not covered by formal arrangements."
